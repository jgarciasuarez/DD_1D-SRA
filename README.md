# Data-driven numerical site response

This repository contains a Mathematica notebook (and the necessary data to run it, see release) that compares the response of a FEA analysis to the data-driven computational mechanics implementation presented in "Data-driven numerical site response".

For the rest of code/data associated to the project, please visit [c4science.ch/source/DD_1D-SRA/](https://c4science.ch/source/DD_1D-SRA/).
